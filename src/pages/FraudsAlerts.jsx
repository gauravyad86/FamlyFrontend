          famly is committed to providing you with a safe and secure platform to search for and find your life partner. While we strive to help users discover the best matches, it is crucial for users to exercise sound judgment to assess another person's genuineness and interest in marriage.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Despite our efforts to maintain a secure platform, we recommend taking the following precautions while using our site and app:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-4">

            <strong>Verify Profile Information:</strong>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-2">
              <li>
                If a user appears to have provided false or incorrect information about their education, profession, income, family, etc., mark such profiles as <span className="font-bold">'Report Abuse'</span> and refrain from contacting them.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-6 mt-2">
              <li>
                If a user requests personal favors such as transporting goods, depositing funds on their behalf, or lending money, immediately cease communication and report the user as advised above.
